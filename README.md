## About my Neural Network

### Intro

This was my first expirementation with neural networks. I always wanted to learn more about neural networks, but everything always made the networks seem so complicated and out of the scope of my knowledge. Reading over technical articles and things of that nature, I found that I was not able to really understand a lot of even the basic terms used. I mean what even is backpropagation? Feed-forward? Neurons??? Obviously I needed to get a better understanding, and what better way to do that then sit down and build one. So, thats what I did. 

### A little more detail

Starting the project was difficult. My first issue was that I realized training the network must not be the hardest part of the project. Therefore, whatever problem I chose to solve must have an easily definable training set. If I had to spend all my time creating a data set to train my network on, I would 100% abandon this project. That is how I chose a Sin function. However, as for the actual neural network, the actual training set can be changed to be anything the user would want to input. The next problem was I wasn't quite sure where to start. I decided to break everything up into the most individualized parts as possible as to make things very specific and easy to work on. That is why each part of the network has it's own class. This made learning as I went very easy. Step one was to define the parts of a neural network, step two was to explore each one, one by one. Finally, I wanted to visualize that the project actually worked. Processing was used to do this. Red line is the expected output, white dots are the outputs given by the network over times trained.
